        <h2><b>OBJECTIVES</b></h2>
        <p>The objective of this experiment is to observe the process of <strong>osmosis</strong> and its effects on
            plant cells by using potato slices in different concentrations of saltwater.</p>

                <h2><b>MATERIALS REQUIRED</b></h2>
            </legend>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium sized potatos(plant cells)</li>
                <li> Common salt (NaCl)</li>
                <li>Distilled water</li>
                <li> knife/blade</li>
                <li>2 petri dish/bowl</li>
                <li>Timer</li>
            </ul>

                <h2><b>PROCEDURE</b></h2>
            </legend>
            <ol>
                <li>Using the knife, cut the potatoes into equal-sized pieces (approximately 1 inch thick) to ensure
                    uniformity.</li>
                <li>In one bowl, prepare a hypertonic solution by mixing 1 cup of distilled water with 2 tablespoons of
                    salt (NaCl).</li>
                <li>Place one potato piece in the hypertonic saltwater solution and the other in a bowl of plain
                    distilled water (hypotonic solution).</li>
                <li>Allow the potato pieces to sit for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, remove the potato pieces and observe any changes in size, texture, and firmness.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </fieldset>

                <h2><b>Observations</b></h2>
            </legend>
            <p>During the experiment, observe the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The potato in the hypertonic solution (saltwater) may feel softer and decrease in size due to
                    <strong>plasmolysis</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The potato in the hypotonic solution (plain water) may feel firmer and increase in size due to
                    <strong>turgor pressure</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Note the differences in texture, firmness, and overall appearance between the two potato pieces</li>
            </ul>
        </fieldset>

                <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
            </legend>
            <p>This experiment illustrates the process of osmosis, where water molecules move across a selectively
                permeable membrane (the potato cell membrane) from an area of lower solute concentration (hypotonic
                solution) to an area of higher solute concentration (hypertonic solution). The potato in the plain water
                swells due to water intake, demonstrating turgor pressure, while the potato in saltwater loses water,
                leading to plasmolysis and a softer texture.</p>

                <h2><b>Applications of Osmosis in Daily Life</h2>
            </legend>
            <p>Osmosis has several practical applications in our daily lives, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food Preservation:</strong> Salting meat and fish creates a hypertonic environment, drawing
                    out moisture and inhibiting bacterial growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Plant Health:</strong> Understanding osmosis helps in watering plants; over-salting soil can
                    harm plants by causing plasmolysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Uses:</strong> Osmosis is crucial in IV fluids for patients, ensuring proper
                    hydration and electrolyte balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Function:</strong> The kidneys use osmosis to filter blood and maintain fluid balance
                    in the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> When vegetables are soaked in saltwater, they lose water and can become
                    more flavorful as they absorb seasonings.</li>
            </ul>
